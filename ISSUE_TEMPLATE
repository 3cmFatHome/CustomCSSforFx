(use template at the bottom after reading everything on this page)

SUPPORT AREA for features THIS project provides
1. This is not a 'request' area for new stuff or legacy add-on features.
2. Do not open a new issue about something this project does not offer or to ask 'is this or that possible?'
3. Instead join the discussion thread to talk and ask questions about what is or could be possible there.
--> General discussions, feedback, questions belong here (v2)
--> https://github.com/Aris-t2/CustomCSSforFx/issues/88
4. Read 'how to report issues properly' before filing a new issue.
--> https://github.com/Aris-t2/CustomCSSforFx/issues/4
5. Make sure there are no '@namespace' references anywhere in your code. They cause CSS code not to work.

Firefox bugs (join general discussion thread to talk about Firefox bugs):
- CSS code might not work, if multi-process mode (e10s) is disabled
- CSS code might not work on macOS/Liinux in userContent.css

Anything releated to multirow tabs, tabs below content or simulated add-on bar should go into:
- TABS BELOW CONTENT SUPPORT THREAD --> https://github.com/Aris-t2/CustomCSSforFx/issues/33
- MULTIROW TABS SUPPORT THREAD --> https://github.com/Aris-t2/CustomCSSforFx/issues/39
- ADD-ON BAR SUPPORT THREAD --> https://github.com/Aris-t2/CustomCSSforFx/issues/73

!!! IMPORTANT !!!  
By filing a new issue you confirm having read and understood the above and all 'how to report a new issue' instructions.
Invalid issue reports might get closed without further notice to keep this projects support area clean.
Thanks for your understanding.
