This is a support area for content available in this project.
It mainly focuses on restoring features, that were previously part of my legacy add-ons on AMO and are possible to restore with CSS.

This is not a "request" area! Join the discussion thread to talk and ask questions about what is or could be possible.
--> General discussions, feedback, questions belong here (v2)

Make sure there are no @namespace references anywhere in your code. Not only are they useless, they also cause CSS code not to work at all.

Read the 'how to report issues properly' before filing an issue report.

By filing an issue report you confirm to have read and understood the above and all 'how to report an issue' instructions.
False/invalid issue reports might get closed without further notice. Thanks for your understanding.
