This is a SUPPORT AREA for features this project provides. This is not a "request" area for new stuff or legacy add-on features this project does not cover!
- Do not open a new issue for something this project doesn't offer or to ask 'is this or that possible?'
- Instead join the discussion thread to talk and ask questions about what is or could be possible there.
--> https://github.com/Aris-t2/CustomCSSforFx/issues/41 (General discussions, feedback, questions belong here (v2))

Read the 'how to report issues properly' before filing an issue report.
--> https://github.com/Aris-t2/CustomCSSforFx/issues/4

Make sure there are no '@namespace' references anywhere in your code. They cause CSS code not to work.

Firefox bugs (join general discussion thread to talk about Firefox bugs):
- CSS code might not work, if multi-process mode (e10s) is disabled
- CSS code might not work on macOS/Liinux in userContent.css 

By filing a new issue you confirm having read and understood the above and all 'how to report a new issue' instructions.
Invalid issue reports might get closed without further notice to keep this projects support area clean.
Thanks for your understanding.
